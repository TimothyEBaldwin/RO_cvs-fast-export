== NAME ==
cvsconvert - perform a Git conversion and test against the CVS original

== SYNOPSIS ==
*cvsconvert* [-v] [repo | repo/module]

== DESCRIPTION ==
cvsconvert performs a conversion of a CVS repository to Git and
checks the tree contents at all branch tips and tags to verify that
the histories are the same.

The single argument must be a path to a directory containing a a CVS
repository or module. If there is only one module it need not be
specified. The Git conversion is left in a directory named after the
repo argument, with a suffix of ".git".

Normal behavior is for the program to report on each branch and tag,
saying "trees match as expected". There are two kinds of problem report:

*"file manifests don't match"*: Indicates that the CVS and Git
versions of this revision in the history contain some filenames that
don't pair up with each other. (Git and CVS ignore-pattern files are
properly paired with each other and will not trigger this message.)
When this message occurs, files in common are not checked for equality

*"%s and %s are different"*: Two corresponding CVS and Git files do 
not compare equal. A diff listing will follow.

Usually a file-difference message will be related to expansion of 
CVS keywords; these can be safely ignored, though they may indicare
that you need to change the default keyword handling with
cvs-fast-export's --expand option.  

Any other file difference message indicates a bug in cvs-fast-export 
or a severe CVS repository malformation.  Such situations should
be reported as bugs.

Manifest mismatches are most likely to occur on files which were
deleted in CVS but persist under later tags in the Git conversion.
CVS does not always retain enough information to track deletions
reliably; you may need to edit in a delete fileop using reposurgeon(1)
to rectify the problem.  

A manifest mismatch might also, however, indicate a real bug in
cvs-fast-export.  If you encounter a bug, please visit the project
website to learn about the bug-reporting procedure. There are specific
things you can do when preaparing the report to make a rapid
resolution of the bug more likely.

== WARNING ==
This program is in early development.  Its interface and features
may change without warning.

== OPTIONS ==
-v::
    Verbose.  Show subcommands as they are being executed.

== LIMITATIONS ==
This program does not cope gracefully if CVS tagnames that are not
legal for Git had to be sanitized during conversion.

== REPORTING BUGS ==
Report bugs to Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>.  The project page is
